## Getting Started

Please follow these simple steps:

## How to Download

1. Download the app for your Android phone from the `Assets` drop down on our [Releases page](https://github.com/ianfromdover/utown-green-ar/releases) (iOS version out in a few months)
    - if your browser asks for the permission to install apps, give it the permission to do so.
    - if the app does not automagically prompt you to install, open your `Files` app and tap the `.apk` file for it to install.
2. On opening the app for the first time, give it the required permissions to enable your AR experience.

## How to Use

1. Point your phone at a flat surface. 
2. Once `meshes` start to appear on them, you can place `balloon spawners` on the `meshes` by tapping.
3. To enter `Photo Mode`, tap the `camera icon` at the bottom left.
4. Photos save to `Files > DCIM`.

> NOTE: If the app freezes at any time, close it and restart the app.
