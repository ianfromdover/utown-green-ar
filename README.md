A public AR installation for NUS' UTown Green.

# Getting Started

Please follow these simple steps:

1. Download the latest `.apk` for your Android phone from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ianfromdover/utown-green-ar/releases) by expanding the drop-down menu. (iOS version out in a few months)
    - if your browser asks for the permission to install apps, give it the permission to do so.
    - if it does not automagically install, you might have to open your Files app and tap it to install.
2. On opening the app for the first time, give it the required permissions to enable your AR experience.
3. In the main menu, click Start to start your AR experience.
4. Point your phone at a flat surface. Once meshes start to appear on them, you are able to place balloon spawners on the meshes.
5. You may take a picture by entering Photo mode using the icon at the bottom left.
    - photos save to `Files > DCIM`.

> NOTE: If the app freezes at any time, close it and restart the app.
